<strong> Admin: </strong> I want to take the user on a "choose your own path" game. Allowing the user
       to answer the correct questions to reach the final level and complete the game.

<strong> User: </strong> I want to have a fun time picking my future by correctly answering question the
      admin has set forth for me. 

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

Unfinished/Expand on: The game is finished, but I would like to go back in and touch up a few things. Maybe add some sound clips/snippets. Possibly change the topic of the game to better suit portfolio purpuses. I would also like to find a way to incorporate more coding languages, such as, jQuery, AJAX, and API's.
